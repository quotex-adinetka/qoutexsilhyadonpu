### Bullish Candlestick Patterns

Bullish candlestick patterns signal a potential reversal of a downtrend
or a continuation of an uptrend. Here are six of the most common bullish
candlestick patterns:

#### 1. Hammer

-   A small body with a lower shadow that is at least twice the length
    of the body.
-   The color of the body can vary, but green hammers are considered to
    be more bullish than red hammers.
